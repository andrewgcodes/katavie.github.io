---

As the title suggests, these are essays that I submitted as part of my application to RSI 2018, and I wasn't accepted.

Interestingly, I've been told that the quality of the writing would've gotten me into prestigious humanities summer programs. Not *quite* what I was aiming for.

I've realized a lot about my application in general in hindsight, and plan to write some application tips in a separate post (this one is long enough as is). I didn't have much guidance while writing these pieces, and made some fundamental mistakes that I would like to help others avoid doing.

**Please don't plagiarize.**

Enjoy and feel free to contact me if you have any questions!

## 1. Articulate why the research fields chosen on the previous page are intriguing and exciting to you. For each sub-field, state what you perceive as the one or two most interesting questions or problems in this area. Explain why these sorts of questions interest you. (4072/5000 characters)

The atom is mostly empty space. Popular science says that if that void were removed, then the human race would fit in one very dense sugar cube. Biology aims to comprehend how arrangements and interactions of molecules—essentially groups of elementary particles in sparsely populated spaces—give rise to the intricacies of life we take for granted.

Biology doesn’t immediately evoke any image in my mind—at least, not the usual double helix or bustling rainforest. Instead, it conjures up layers, like the blankets I use in the winter to stay warm, or like the skin of an onion, which I’m sure possesses some evolutionary raison d’être.

Biology is the nitty-gritty: how a cleverly designed molecule evades antibodies in the bloodstream and navigates into the pocket of a protein, inducing an electrical signal and cascade of reactions. Biology is the patient who is prescribed daily doses of that molecule and may, as a result, lead a longer and more fulfilling life. Biology is the big picture: combining meticulous clinical trials and longitudinal studies to reveal why the drug affects certain populations differently.

In this vast field, it becomes important to have something that unifies it all: computational biology.

We as a species excel at creative problem solving, but computers are much more efficient at storing and manipulating abundant information. Less than two decades ago, the human genome was completely sequenced. Since then, we have identified and developed cures for diseases caused by mutations as small as a single nucleotide. Finding the needle in the haystack is tedious for a human, but perfectly suitable for a machine.

As sequencing technology improves, the bottleneck becomes figuring out what roles regions of DNA have. As a result, an important problem is fully annotating genomes, a process that generally requires complex workflows and is especially difficult for newly sequenced species. Furthermore, we are now exploring other aspects of genomics, such as small RNAs and epigenetic modifications of DNA, which potentially hold keys to expanding our understanding of the connection between genotype and phenotype. Developments in computational biology can help us automate and perform these analyses.

Another interesting area in computational biology is systems biology. The advent of gene-editing technologies like CRISPR and experimentation with stem cells has presented society with ethical and economic dilemmas. In an age where science is considerably politicized, it is important for people to be able to understand and communicate the implications of research. Systems biology takes a comprehensive view on modeling, and its ability to address multifaceted issues fascinates me.

Chemistry, too, is a subject that touches upon diverse topics. It covers areas relevant to my interests in both biology and physics, in addition to being an intriguing discipline itself. In my dual enrollment chemistry course, I first learned the concept of spectroscopy: studying the interactions between matter and electromagnetic radiation.

I found it striking that we can uncover clues about the source of radiation based on the marks it leaves behind—its emission or absorption spectra. From our distant Earth we can deduce the atmospheric elements of exoplanets light years away. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy has yielded atomic-resolution structures of thousands of proteins. Photoacoustic spectroscopy is able to detect gaseous particles in concentrations of parts per billion or trillion.

Learning about this technique helped me realize what much of science is, though it may seem obvious: discovering and describing nature based on the evidence it leaves us. The peaks and dips of a spectrograph create a landscape that represents how electrons in their empty spaces behave. Compelling problems lie in refining the technique itself, and advancements in this state-of-the-art technology, at the interface of chemistry and physics, will certainly lead to novel solutions to questions far beyond this field.

## 2. What are your long-range goals? (3865/5000 characters)

When I was thirteen years old, I defined my life’s purpose on a Google Docs file. Though now I would certainly select a more sophisticated typeface than Comfortaa, the words—carefully chosen and characteristically concise—were packed with a meaning and backed by a mindset that still profoundly resonate with me.

My interests have shifted time and time again as I’ve discovered new ideas. In the document, I tried to identify and define my underlying principles and values—a big picture to unify the details. At thirteen, I figured that many misunderstandings and disagreements occur when nuances in meaning are lost in translation. I wanted to ultimately improve global communication through smarter natural language processing technology and a philosophy of culturally-aware interface design. 

My goal now is to conduct, communicate, and apply beneficial research. In both cases, the driving force has been to develop skills and use them to positively impact the world. Regardless of the specifics, however, the first step is educating myself so that my knowledge and expertise can make a truly substantial impact.

During college, I plan on majoring in a scientific field and eagerly pursuing research, extracurricular activities, and other opportunities available to me. I will likely continue onto graduate school to gain and contribute to knowledge in a specific discipline. After that, I might become a researcher in academia or industry, but I’m also considering pursuing entrepreneurial ventures based on breakthroughs in biotechnology and engineering.

Overall, I’m flexible about my long-range plans. I’m constantly engaged in one project or another, delving into questions that excite me. Because I don’t always have access to a laboratory, much of it is computational and often independent, but this has not restricted my curiosity. Exposing myself to diverse disciplines, from genetics to solid-state physics to digital humanities, enables me to gain more comprehensive and creative perspectives on the problems that plague the world. Science holds tremendous potential for advancing society, but I firmly believe that research in isolation is not sufficient.

Basic biological findings means little to the vast majority of people if they are not translated into effective and accessible medicine. Advancements in physics and engineering can provide valuable solutions to pressing issues, particularly concerning energy and our other limited resources. Additionally, it is essential to communicate complex scientific breakthroughs to policymakers and the public. Such knowledge is inextricably intertwined with our lives.

Science journalism weaves hard facts with the allure of human emotion and narrative, while generally avoiding being overly sensational. Developments in web-based technologies, as well as their increasingly widespread and pervasive accessibility, have led to an interest in creating interactive visualizations and other representations of scientific information. Innovative reporters are already starting to do this in their articles, but those remain seen by only the small part of the population that actively seeks it out.

Scientific and numerical literacy has been a major concern especially in the United States, among children and adult citizens alike. For the former, there has never been a better time to learn how to construct mental models of natural phenomena and approach problems logically and creatively. For the latter, understanding of science informs wiser decisions and opinions in a democratic society. There is a need for change in the way science as a philosophy is perceived and taught, and I would like that to be part of my long-range involvements. Regardless of my job title, therefore, I aspire to maintain a balance between making discoveries and explaining how they can impact us, our communities, and our world.

## 3. What activities and/or hobbies demonstrate your leadership, creativity and uniqueness? (4980/5000 characters)

The song’s lyrics were literally all Greek to me. For my fifth-grade self, looking up a translation would not suffice. Instead, I decided to learn the language. After three years of deciphering Greek news articles and immersing myself in Greek music, I wasn’t fluent, but I had joined a community of language enthusiasts, inspired by a handful of polyglots around the world who boasted proficiency in dozens of tongues.

In eighth grade, I started learning Latin. I pored over a textbook from 1902, so old that it was out of copyright and completely digitized on Google Books. I copiously annotated hundreds of lines from the Aeneid, a brute force method of digesting Roman poetry. There was no grand scheme. I did whatever made sense in the moment—step by step. In a few months, I became the first freshman at my school to take Latin 2.

As a sophomore, I self-studied AP Computer Science, AP Statistics, and a discrete math course. Currently, I’m the only junior in my calculus class, having taught myself the prerequisite material. But why did I do all this? In addition to appreciating the challenge and charm inherent to learning. I also had a growing passion for science and knew that programming and math would be essential.

With science, too, little steps over time created a central part of my identity. I hadn’t always been interested in research. Growing up, I was not one of those kids who deconstructed toys and reengineered them with new features. If anything, I just took things apart—didn’t quite reach step two.

In middle school, we did mandatory science fair projects. It was natural for me to continue freshman year, but I soon realized that no one at my high school participated in science fairs. With no established research program to guide me through the process, I did what I had learned: find a next step, put my heart into it, and repeat.

I had only learned about the procedure for entering the regional science fair a few months before the deadline. At the last minute, the science fair coordinator introduced me to a microbiology teacher, and we hastily came up with a plan that explored a standard laboratory exercise further. We were to investigate how PVC, a ubiquitous and carcinogenic plastic, affects bacterial transformation and antimicrobial resistance. I eagerly made up for lost time, reading a packet containing the background information and protocol for transformation from cover to cover, trekking through scientific journal articles for the first time, and performing experiments in early mornings and on weekends.

At the state science fair, I met judges who not only suggested future experimental designs, but also expressed surprise that I was only in ninth grade and encouraged me to continue. Later, I published a report on the project in the Journal of Emerging Investigators. My teacher had had students submit to that high school journal before, but this was the first on many fronts: the first solo-authored paper, the first one written by a freshman, and the first time I realized, “Huh, I can discover something new.”

When sophomore year arrived, I was determined to take the initiative. After reading an article about molecular dynamics, I became intrigued by the notion of combining my interests in computing, biophysics, and chemistry. I reached out to a group at the University of Massachusetts Lowell, and a graduate student and I conducted simulations of potential drugs against botulinum neurotoxin, a potent poison with surprising therapeutic and cosmetic uses.

At the state science fair’s public viewing, I presented my project to a curious stranger. That person was Dr. Evelyn Hu, a Harvard professor, who was impressed and later invited me to work with her research group during the summer.

Dr. Hu teaches applied physics and electrical engineering; her doctoral students, among the best in the world, experiment with photonic devices related to quantum computing and high-efficiency lasers. I knew nothing about any of those. To thrive that summer, I had to be ready to make the most of the unexpected opportunity by reading, asking, and most importantly, doing.

Fortunately, my perseverance and ability to grasp content quickly helped me contribute to their research. At Harvard, I refined a process to shape micron-sized lasers into desired geometries. The lasers, made of GaN and InGaN alloys, contained quantum dots and quantum wells. I learned software to simulate the properties of semiconductor devices, and visualized data to elucidate electron behavior in QDs and QWs.

Through my experiences, I have discovered the value of being the leader of my own education. Science contains a multitude of information that one would not be able to learn passively. It requires actively doing research and making connections between different fields. My projects, ranging from biology to physics, computational to wet lab, reflect my uniquely interdisciplinary interests and capabilities.

## 4. Describe your participation in extracurricular or community outreach activities. (3485/5000 characters)

Every year, major cities around the world host a one-day programming event called the Stupid Hackathon, whose website features absurd categories including “privatizing eyebrows” and “extracting value from barely audible sighs at a dinner party”. Most hackathons unironically claim to generate useful projects, but the Stupid Hackathon pokes fun at one of their common criticisms: these code fests, though certainly in vogue, often fall short of their catchy headlines.

Nonetheless, the prospect of inventing something in several intense sessions, making new friends, and sharing my process with others excites me. I’ve attended and won awards at several high school hackathons, including Blueprint, organized by HackMIT, and MAHacks, an entrepreneurship-focused event in Boston.

When the director of MAHacks, a high school student himself, encouraged me to apply for an organizer role, however, I hesitated. Participating was one thing, but being on the other side, promoting a mission to which I wasn’t entirely dedicated, was another. After all, why another hackathon?

I realized that I could use this as an opportunity to fix the drawbacks I saw, and chose to join the team. MAHacks aimed to promote entrepreneurship alongside the technology-focused nature of a hackathon, but had struggled to implement this unique vision. I introduced tracks, which are fields such as medical technology and education, to give attendees inspiration for solutions to real industry problems. Through this and prizes that connect top teams to startup incubators, MAHacks now increases the chances that the projects will live long and prosper beyond the event.

MAHacks is run by high schoolers, for high schoolers—a source of pride but also a challenge. Coming from a school with few STEM extracurriculars and only a handful of outdated coding classes, I understand that for many teenagers, diving into an all-day or overnight sprint to make something from scratch can be foreign and daunting. The tracks, combined with guidance from mentors, workshops, and peers, also serve to help participants who are stuck simply because they don’t know where to begin.

My leadership role in this community initiative has also helped me improve in other extracurricular activities. At my school, I’m president of the Chess Club and Model United Nations Club. For both MAHacks and these clubs, I think critically about the experiences of people who join, and why they stay or leave.

For years, our focus has never been to win prestigious tournaments and conferences. None of our chess players dream of becoming grandmasters, and only a few students in Model UN intend to pursue international relations. Most simply want to enjoy the low-commitment after school activity. To me, that’s perfectly fine. In fact, I can teach difficult concepts, such as chess strategy or Parliamentary procedure, which might otherwise be frustrating and stressful, in a casual environment. However, knowing and accommodating that reality makes all the difference—if I force them to do things they don’t want, the close friendships we have in our clubs would be replaced with tension.

In essence, that’s why I do it. By exposing ourselves to new things on the side, though they may not be our “passions”, we gain not only transferable skills like critical thinking and debate, but also lasting memories. Playing a role in enabling that and being part of the community formed makes these activities important to me.

## 5. How did you hear about RSI? What aspects most appeal to you? Why did you apply? (1387/2000 characters)

I learned about RSI from personal websites of several past Rickoids. The aspect that most appeals to me is the immersive community, including fellow participants, counselors and staff, mentors, and the MIT and greater Boston community. It would be an incredible experience to surround myself with peers who share my drive for research, as well as scientists with knowledge and wisdom.

Through my past research experiences, I recognize the value of being able to converse with someone; it is often the impetus for novel ideas, encouragement and advice for carrying out difficult experimental procedures, and the "aha!" moment that demystifies confusing concepts. I also love that RSI attracts and accepts students from all over the world. Though I personally would not be traveling very far to attend RSI, others hail from continents and cultures away. In the end, it is not simply a research internship, but the formation of lifelong friendships, a period of immense personal growth, and the gathering of diverse youth unified by common goals.

I applied because those things are exactly what I would spend my ideal summer doing. Diving into research projects fascinates and excites me. There is no doubt that I would somehow find a way to do it anyway, but tackling the unknowns of science would be much more difficult without the world-class support that the RSI community offers.
