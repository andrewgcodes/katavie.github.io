<p>Hey, I’m Kat, a high schooler from Lowell, MA, and incoming first-year at MIT, where I plan to major in <a href="https://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics-admissions/undergraduate-programs/6-14-computer-science-economics-and-data-science">Data Science</a> and minor in <a href="https://anthropology.mit.edu/">Anthropology</a>. Above all else, I value integrity, kindness, and gratitude.</p>

<p>For the first time in history, all of the world’s issues involve STEM, but these fields remain daunting and inaccessible for many. I founded <a href="scienceandus.org">Science &amp; Us</a> to change that. We organize events to help high schoolers communicate science and better understand the complex issues they care about. We’re currently working on a book of stories from people who connect STEM and the public!</p>

<p>I’ve attended many hackathons—weekend-long events for making tech projects with the help of new friends, mentors, and free food. Unfortunately, most hackathon projects are abandoned afterward, and that’s what <a href="https://mahacks.com">MAHacks</a> aims to fix. I organize hackathons that offer students experiences—office tours, job shadows, chats with entrepreneurs and engineers—that keep them excited about making cool things.</p>

<p>I serve as co-captain of FIRST Robotics Competition Team 5962 and am among the 0.9% of applicants to earn the NCWIT National <a href="https://aspirations.org">Aspirations in Computing Award</a> in 2019. I’ve conducted scientific research at <a href="https://hugroup.seas.harvard.edu/">Harvard</a>, UMass Lowell, and independently, and shared my work at the National Junior Science &amp; Humanities Symposium, Massachusetts Science &amp; Engineering Fair, and <em>Journal of Emerging Investigators</em>.</p>

<p>When I’m not working on projects, I’m probably scrolling through memes or exercising—maybe both.</p>
