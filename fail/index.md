# Failure Resume :)

A failure resume is, as its name suggests, a list of rejections and setbacks. This concept originated in [academia](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/03/smarter-living/failure-resume.html), but can be applied to improve one's career, resilience, and approach to challenges in any walk of life.

I've organized my setbacks by year (starting with 2018), and what constitutes a "failure" here is based solely on my own judgement. It's important to not only list the failures, but also learn from them, so I will add reflections to some of them (in progress). This isn't an exhaustive list.
