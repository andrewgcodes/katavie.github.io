# Katherine Huang

Hey, I'm Kat, a high schooler from Lowell, MA, and incoming first-year at MIT, where I plan to major in [Data Science](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics-admissions/undergraduate-programs/6-14-computer-science-economics-and-data-science) and minor in [Anthropology](https://anthropology.mit.edu/). Above all else, I value integrity, kindness, and gratitude.

For the first time in history, all of the world's issues involve STEM, but these fields remain daunting and inaccessible for many. I founded [Science & Us](scienceandus.org) to change that. We organize events to help high schoolers communicate science and better understand the complex issues they care about. We're currently working on a book of stories from people who connect STEM and the public!

I've attended many hackathons—weekend-long events for making tech projects with the help of new friends, mentors, and free food. Unfortunately, most hackathon projects are abandoned afterward, and that's what [MAHacks](https://mahacks.com) aims to fix. I organize hackathons that offer students experiences—office tours, job shadows, chats with entrepreneurs and engineers—that keep them excited about making cool things.

I serve as co-captain of FIRST Robotics Competition Team 5962 and am among the 0.9% of applicants to earn the NCWIT National [Aspirations in Computing Award](https://aspirations.org) in 2019. I've conducted scientific research at [Harvard](https://hugroup.seas.harvard.edu/), UMass Lowell, and independently, and shared my work at the National Junior Science & Humanities Symposium, Massachusetts Science & Engineering Fair, and *Journal of Emerging Investigators*.

When I'm not working on projects, I'm probably scrolling through memes or exercising—maybe both.

## What I'm doing now*

- On a weeklong break from school!
- Preparing for AP exams
- Looking for a venue and fundraising for MAHacks V
- Planning the Science & Us Makeathon and book!
- Strategizing about my robotics team's outreach, fundraising, training, and branding
- Working on Formable (a tool to make Google Forms super customizable and responsive) and some other small web projects
- Exploring storytelling using writing, data, interactive web content, and/or video
- Trying to get my splits back and achieve single-arm push ups
- Reading: *Evicted* by Matthew Desmond, *Educated* by Tara Westover, *Lean In* by Sheryl Sandberg
