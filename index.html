        <p>Hi :)</p>

        <p>Eventually, this website will be informative to people other than myself. Today is not that day.</p>

        <p><b>March 2017.</b> Currently, I am:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Using computational methods (docking, molecular dynamics) to study small-molecule inhibitors against botulinum neurotoxin, a poison that causes deadly muscle paralysis</li>
            <li>Independently studying AP Statistics and AP Computer Science A</li>
            <li>Preparing for a Model United Nations conference</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>April to June 2017.</b> In the upcoming weeks, I will be:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Independently reviewing and learning Calculus I-III</li>
            <li>Researching the effect of prescriptivism in school on studentsâ€™ language beliefs</li>
            <li>Running weekly 5k races</p>
        </ul>

        <p><b>Summer 2017.</b> In the upcoming months, I will be:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Hopefully attending the NEHSJC Summer Workshop at Regis College and The Boston Globe, as well as Junction at MIT</li>
            <li>Taking university courses in Discrete Structures and Differential Equations</li>
            <li>Learning Python</li>
            <li>Developing my skills in mathematical thinking and proof-writing</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>2017-2018.</b> Later, I hope to:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Retake the SAT around October 2017</li>
            <li>Conduct biostatistics and bioinformatics research</li>
        </ul>
