					<p>I founded <a href="http://scienceandus.org">Science & Us</a>, a youth-led organization that aims to make science more engaging and relevant. We teach high schoolers how to communicate complex topics to diverse audiences and about interdisciplinary STEM careers (e.g. science writing and policy) that are rarely mentioned in school.</p>

					<p>I serve as co-director for <a href="http://mahacks.com">MAHacks</a>, an entrepreneurship-focused high school hackathon, or collaborative programming and design event, in Boston. We encourage participants to solve problems and offer prizes (e.g. opportunities for mentorship, accelerators, and learning programs) that help them continue their projects beyond our event—an exception in the hackathon world.</p>

					<p>Currently, I'm conducting research at <a href="http://faculty.uml.edu/frederic_chain/">UMass Lowell</a> on how DNA methylation, which can activate and suppress genes, contributes to the survival and evolution of duplicate genes, a major source of genetic novelty and diversity.</p>
					<p>Last summer at <a href="https://hugroup.seas.harvard.edu/">Harvard University</a>, I helped refine a protocol for developing nanoscale laser cavities made of semiconductor materials containing quantum dots and quantum wells.</p>

					<p>I'm also a co-captain for <a href="http://mvrobotics.net">FIRST Robotics Competition Team 5962</a>, composed of members from Lowell, Dracut, and surrounding towns. I'm a founder of <a href="http://tedxlowellhigh.com">TEDxLowellHigh</a>, an event featuring talks on ideas worth spreading and celebrating diverse voices in Lowell, MA.</p>

					<p>Above all else, I value <b>integrity, respect, and a love for learning and being open-minded</b>. Some of my other interests include web development, data science, handlettering, reading, and <a href="">writing</a>. When I'm not having fun working on projects, I'm probably scrolling through memes or exercising—maybe both.</p>
