        <ul>
            <li>Using computational methods (docking, molecular dynamics) to study small-molecule inhibitors against botulinum neurotoxin, a poison that causes deadly muscle paralysis</li>
            <li>Independently studying AP Statistics and AP Computer Science A</li>
        </ul>

            <li>Taking university courses in Discrete Structures and Differential Equations</li>
            <li>Independently learning biochemistry and physics</li>
            <li>Working in an enjoyable lab</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>2017-2018.</b> Later, I will:</p>
