            <h1>Katherine Huang</h1>
            <p>Hey, I'm Kat, a high schooler from Lowell, MA, and incoming freshman at MIT. Above all else, I value <b>integrity, respect, and open-mindedness</b>.</p>
            <p>I started <a href="https://scienceandus.org">Science & Us</a>, a nonprofit that makes science more approachable. We hold events to help students make multimedia communication projects and learn about careers bridging STEM (science, technology, engineering, math) and the public.</p>
            <p>I’m co-captain of FIRST Robotics Competition Team 5962, and lead organizer of <a href="https://mahacks.com">MAHacks</a>, an entrepreneurship-focused high school hackathon in greater Boston. I’m among the 0.9% of applicants to earn the NCWIT National <a href="https://www.aspirations.org/blog/four-hundred-us-high-school-women-are-recognized-technological-achievements-0">Aspirations in Computing</a> Award in 2019.</p>
            <p>I’ve conducted scientific research at Harvard University, the University of Massachusetts Lowell, and independently. I’ve presented bioinformatics and biotechnology projects at the National Junior Science and Humanities Symposium and Massachusetts Science and Engineering Fair.</p>
            <p>Some of my other interests include writing, hand lettering, and admiring interactive, data-driven journalism on <a href="https://pudding.cool/">The Pudding</a>. When I'm not working on projects, I'm probably scrolling through memes or exercising—maybe both.</p>
            
            
            <h2>What I’m doing now*</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Preparing for robotics competitions</li>
                <li>Planning the next Science & Us Makeathon and preparing our presentation for <a href="https://www.sciencetalk.org/">Science Talk</a> in Portland, OR</li>
                <li>Organizing (trying to get bread for) MAHacks V</li>
                <li>Reading: <i>Statistics Done Wrong</i> by Alex Reinhart,  <i>Evicted</i> by Matthew Desmond, <i>Period Power</i> by Nadya Okamoto, <i>The Lady Tasting Tea</i> by David Salsburg, and <i>Lean In</i> by Sheryl Sandberg</li>
		<li>Recently read <i>The Cheat Code</i> by Brian Wong</li>
		<li>School is still a thing—struggling in my Statistics class but it's fine :)</li>
		<li>Working on improving myself emotionally/mentally, physically, and professionally</li>
            </ul>
